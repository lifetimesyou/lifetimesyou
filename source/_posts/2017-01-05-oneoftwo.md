You hung in space, suspended twenty-one feet above the surface, motionless. Your bare body, pure of form, defied gravity, afloat over the endless ocean of mankind, wrapped in the chilly embrace of the ambience.

Time stopped. Minutes turned to hours and back to seconds, and none of the river's currents bore any meaning.

With your arms outstretched to farthest horizons, you were a boat rocking the waves of air, inhuman in the stillness.

Light reflected off of the immaculate crystals circling your shell, illuminating the strange surrounding creatures, hopelessly pinned to the ground below.

Your mind was unoccupied and free---free from thought and worry, from pain and misery. From everything. Anything.

And beings stopped and they stared. Oh, how they stared. Some taken aback, some mildly amused, finally some halting their existences to join the limbo, led by your example.

By yours only. In a flash, in a glimpse, they bore witness to the arcane ritual, your transformation into something otherworldly, something holy. Alone, yet together; separate, but whole. Shoulder to shoulder. Side by side. With you.

For a fraction of an instant, your static, alien entity had penetrated the precious barriers of their analog lives, their digital thoughts, bricks and mortar, metal and glass---like threads bonding in the tying of a knot---and you felt you had been born exactly for this. As if you had found your purpose and role in this dark world, a reason to repel and not succumb to the forces of evil. To soldier on. Against the nothingness. Against the worthlessness.

Not all of them cared. Many had remained perfectly still, minding their own business, impartial to your great awakening. Life had usually been like this.

But not now. No, not now, when even a few of them partook in your spectacle of shade and shine. It was enough. They were enough. For them you were beautiful. Unique. Special. A magical wonder to behold. What had always been your heart's ultimate desire.

This is the first paragraph of the second part. It should be somewhat long, so it spans at least four lines of text, for the gradient to be clearly visible. Otherwise it might not be noticeable which would be a shame.
